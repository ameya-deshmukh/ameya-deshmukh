### Hi there, I'm Ameya Deshmukh!ðŸ‘‹ 



## 
- ðŸ”­ I'm primarily interested in zero-knowledge cryptography, efficient distributed consensus and cryptoeconomics.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [Nix](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/language/index.html) and exploring the Nix ecosystem
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything related to blockchain development (bounties on [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/explorer?network=mainnet&idx_status=open&applicants=ALL&order_by=-web3_created) for example), cryptography engineering and distributed systems.
- ðŸ¥… 2023 Goals: Contribute to open source blockchain projects and participate in as many hackathons as possible
- âš¡ Fun fact: I made this Readme while waiting for [nerdfonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) to download for my NeoVim setup.
